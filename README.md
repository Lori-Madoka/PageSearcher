# PageSearcher
Smol-ish search frame for objects, horrifically basic and not optimal at all. It is closer to a search engine than what I originally intended (IDR what I originally had planned for this). Adding things is a nightmare but it does work. Adaptable to most applications given enough time to dump stuff into object arrays. (I was up late and felt like doing stuff)
